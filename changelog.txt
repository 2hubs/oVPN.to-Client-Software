+ to verify releases: add our CA to your "Trusted CA" Store and allow purposes only to "codesign" !

+ fixed app-crash bug on serverwindow reload after config update
+ updated language, countrynames and ms-windows theme
+ some high resolution DPI fixes

+ removed server entry from systray: leftclick on systray icon opens serverwindow
+ leftclick systray opens serverwindow and leftclick again sends serverwindow to HIDE (keep window data in memory).

+ wait ~30s on start for interface to come up
+ fixed option: save apikey in file
